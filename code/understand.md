## Understanding Comparison Methods and Terms
### Confusion Matrix
Imagine you have a box of apples and oranges, and you want to sort them correctly. A confusion matrix is like a special table that shows you how well you did. It has four parts:
- **True Positives (TP):** How many apples you correctly put in the "apple" box.
- **True Negatives (TN):** How many oranges you correctly put in the "orange" box.
- **False Positives (FP):** How many oranges you mistakenly put in the "apple" box (Oops!).
- **False Negatives (FN):** How many apples you mistakenly put in the "orange" box (Oops again!).

### Precision Score
Precision is like checking how good you are at putting only apples in the "apple" box. It tells you the percentage of items in the "apple" box that are actually apples.

### Accuracy Score
Accuracy is like asking, "How many times did I get it right overall?" It tells you the percentage of apples and oranges you sorted correctly out of all the items.

### Recall Score
Recall is like checking how good you are at finding all the apples. It tells you the percentage of all the real apples that you correctly put in the "apple" box.

### F1 Score
F1 Score is like a special magic number that balances both precision and recall. It gives you one number that combines how good you are at putting apples in the "apple" box (precision) and finding all the apples (recall).

### Example to Understand
Imagine you have 10 apples and 10 oranges:

- You correctly put 8 apples in the "apple" box (True Positives, TP).
- You correctly put 9 oranges in the "orange" box (True Negatives, TN).
- You mistakenly put 1 orange in the "apple" box (False Positives, FP).
- You mistakenly put 2 apples in the "orange" box (False Negatives, FN).

Now, let's see how these numbers are calculated:

- **Confusion Matrix:** 
  - TP = 8
  - TN = 9
  - FP = 1
  - FN = 2

- **Precision:** How many items in the "apple" box are actually apples?
  \[ \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \frac{8}{8 + 1} = \frac{8}{9} \approx 0.89 \]

- **Accuracy:** How many items did you sort correctly out of all items?
  \[ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} = \frac{8 + 9}{8 + 9 + 1 + 2} = \frac{17}{20} = 0.85 \]

- **Recall:** How many of the real apples did you correctly put in the "apple" box?
  \[ \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \frac{8}{8 + 2} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \]

- **F1 Score:** A balance between precision and recall.
  \[ \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} = 2 \times \frac{0.89 \times 0.8}{0.89 + 0.8} \approx 0.84 \]
